# Clustering

This application demonstrates various clustering algorithms applied to public datasets of points in two dimensions. The datasets were obtained from the [ClustEval](https://clusteval.sdu.dk/1/datasets) website, and the algorithms were largely obtained from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). The widgets were created using [reactopya](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/reactopya).

The [ccm_widgets](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/ccm_widgets) Python package is used here and can also be used to render these examples in various other contexts such as Jupyter or Colab notebooks and stand-alone desktop widgets.
